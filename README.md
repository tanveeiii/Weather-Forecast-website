# InfoWeather - Weather Forecasting Website

##### I have made a website which tells the current weather details of a place.
##### As you open the website, the weather details of your present location will be displayed. There is a search bar on the top right corner of the webpage. Enter the location of which you want to know the weather details and press enter or click on the search icon. The weather details of the entered location will now be displayed.
##### On entering the location , first the location is sent to a geocoding api which fetches the latitude and longitude of that location. Then that latitude and longitude are sent to the weather api which fetches the data of the weather of that location.
##### The current location is fetched using the geolocation api.
##### The website requires internet to be functional and will not be able to fetch and display the weather details without internet.
